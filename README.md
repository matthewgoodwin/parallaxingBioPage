# parallaxingBioPage
this section is completely designed for non-pertinent, random trials

10-10-15 : This section includes a javascript parallax scrolling function, but it is very choppy while mouse scrolling. I need a smooth scrolling function or plug-in.
fixed navigation at top, with images supplied with image tags and styled on the css sheet.
At the momment there are two large background sections. The first being the large image of myself which parallaxes and is covered by another background image.
NEXT: I need to add icons for the navigations. also I need to figure out why the parallaxing isnt smooth on chrome.
